🧪 14-Day Python Learning Journey
These projects are part of my 14-day hands-on Python roadmap.

🗂️ Days 1–8: I practiced Python basics, loops, functions, data cleaning, and analysis using a small fictional HR dataset inspired by the TV show “Parks and Recreation.”

🛳️ Days 9–14: I applied all those skills to a real-world dataset — the Titanic survival dataset from Kaggle — culminating in a complete machine learning project.


🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis with Python
I used the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts survival outcomes. The goal was to go from raw data to a clean, model-ready dataset and apply data analysis, visualization, and ML techniques — all using Python.

🚀 What This Project Covers
✅ Data loading and inspection with pandas

✅ Data cleaning (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features)

✅ Feature engineering (e.g. extracting titles, creating family size)

✅ Categorical encoding and data transformation

✅ Visualization (bar plots, heatmaps)

✅ Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression)

✅ Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

📊 Dataset
Source: Titanic survival dataset (train.csv from Kaggle)

Total rows: 891

Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🧠 Key Insights
Passengers with families had slightly higher survival rates.

Female passengers had significantly better survival outcomes.

First-class passengers had the highest chances of survival.

Certain titles (like “Master” and “Mrs”) had predictive value.
