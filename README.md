🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Cleaning & ML Project
This project is part of my 14-day Python learning journey, focused on real-world data analysis and machine learning using the Titanic dataset. The goal was to clean the data, engineer useful features, and build a logistic regression model to predict survival.

📁 Files
titanic_cleaned.csv – Final cleaned dataset ready for ML.

titanic_notebook.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with all preprocessing steps and model training.

🔧 What I Did
✅ Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
✅ Cleaned missing data (Age, Embarked)
✅ Engineered new features (FamilySize, Title)
✅ Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, Title)
✅ Scaled numerical values (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch)
✅ Built and trained a logistic regression model
✅ Evaluated model accuracy and predictions

📊 Tools Used
Python

pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

seaborn, matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Model Performance
Accuracy Score: 0.79 (approximate, may vary)

Model: Logistic Regression

💡 What I Learned
Data preprocessing is crucial before ML

Feature engineering boosts model understanding

scikit-learn makes training/testing easy

Clean code & comments make analysis easier to follow
